| **200** | OK, Returned when the card and its dependencies has been successfully deleted.  |  * X-Src-Cx-Flow-Id - The X-Src-Cx-Flow-Id ensures that back-to-back API calls will be sent to the same Mastercard server to maintain session affinity. When you make your initial API call, Secure Card on File responds with the X-Src-Cx-Flow-Id in the header. The X-Src-Cx-Flow-Id returned in this response should be used in the next back-to-back call to ensure these calls are directed to the same server. If the same X-Src-Cx-Flow-Id is not used for back-to-back calls, you may encounter site replication errors. <br>  * X-Src-Response-Host - The X-Src-Response-Host is used to direct all calls from the same client to the same server to maintain session affinity. When you make your initial API call, Mastercard Checkout Solutions responds with the X-Src-Response-Host in the HTTP header. The X-Src-Response-Host that is returned will contain a site Specific URL that must be used in the subsequent calls to ensure these calls are directed to the same server that returned the initial response. <br>  |
| **400** | Bad Request. Reason code of &#x60;INVALID_ARGUMENT&#x60; Identifies a malformed or invalid request. Use cases:   * Mandatory Query parameters are missing example &#39;srcClientId&#39; is not provided.   * Query parameters provided value has invalid format example, &#39;srcCorrelationId&#39; is not in UUID format.    Reason code of &#x60;INVALID_STATE&#x60; identifies a validation failed on request. Use cases:   * &#x60;srcClientId&#x60; or &#x60;srcDpaId&#x60; or &#x60;serviceId&#x60; is invalid and does not resolve to an entity in SRC system. Example &#x60;srcClientId&#x60; is not recognised.   * Request Body JSON schema validation failure.   * Data Type validation failure.  |  -  |
| **403** | Forbidden. API will return this response if identifier validation fails.  |  -  |
| **404** | Not Found. Identifies a missing Path Parameter. Possible reasons:    * &#x60;cardId&#x60; is not provided.   * &#x60;cardId&#x60; does not exist in the system.  |  -  |
