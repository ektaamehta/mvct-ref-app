Mastercard Checkout Solutions will by default return a new srcCorrelationId in each response, but Integrators may choose to populate previously used srcCorrelationIds in subsequent requests to correlate their activity under a single ID. This can be done by providing a Mastercard generated srcCorrelationId in the request, or by generating your own ID in the same format. SrcCorrelationId is used for tracking and troubleshooting purposes within Mastercard&#39;s ecosystem.  |  |
